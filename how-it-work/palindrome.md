### Palindrome

[Back Home](../README.md)

The `isPalindrome` function checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Here's how the `isPalindrome` function works:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
  return str === str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

1. `str.split('')` - This line converts the input string into an array of characters. For example, if `str` is `"racecar"`, it becomes `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']`.

2. `.reverse()` - This method reverses the order of the elements in the array. So, `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']` becomes `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']` (reversed).

3. `.join('')` - This method converts the reversed array back into a string. So, `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']` becomes `"racecar"`.

4. `str === strReversed` - This line compares the original string with the reversed string. If they are equal, it means the input string is a palindrome.

Here's an example of how the function works:

```javascript
isPalindrome('racecar'); // Returns true
```

Explanation:

- The string `"racecar"` is passed as an argument to the function.
- The function converts it to an array of characters: `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']`.
- It then reverses the array: `['r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'r']`.
- Finally, it converts the reversed array back into a string: `"racecar"`.
- The original string and the reversed string are compared (`"racecar" === "racecar"`), which is true, so the function returns `true`.

This function works for checking palindromes in a case-sensitive manner. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert both `str` and `strReversed` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing.

The Python code provided checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Here's how the code works:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()  # Convert the string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    return s == s[::-1]
```

**How it work in `Python`**:

1. `def is_palindrome(s):` - This line defines a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string `s` as an argument.

2. `s = s.lower()` - This line converts the input string `s` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This step is added to make the comparison case-insensitive, so "Racecar" and "racecar" are treated as palindromes.

3. `s == s[::-1]` - This line checks whether the original string `s` is equal to its reverse.

   - `s[::-1]` is a Python slicing technique that reverses the string. For example, if `s` is "racecar," then `s[::-1]` is also "racecar" because it reads the same backward.

4. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome (i.e., the original string is equal to its reverse), and it returns `False` otherwise.

Here are examples of how the code works:

```python
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"))  # Output: True (ignores spaces and punctuation, and is case-insensitive)
```

In summary, the Python code defines a function that converts the input string to lowercase, reverses it, and then checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the input string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.
